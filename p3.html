 <p>   I developed my sketches based on the first thing that popped in my mind after seeing the prompt and examples of generated art. I thought it would be fun to create a randomized cat with exaggerated features and silly faces! Keeping in mind the constraints of this project, I incorperated different ways that the cat might change in my two sketches.</p>

<h2>        Discoveries: </h2> <p> 
  From this project I learned about the importance of trial and error and how helpful forums and youtube videos are. I focused on understanding the logic behind example code before incorperating and altering it to what I needed. By experimenting on a different P5 project I could fine tune things before pasting them in to ensure that what I had before wouldn't break. A lot of it was trial and error and I learned a bit more about how transformations function in P5. I think my cat turned out well, but in the future I'd like to figure out more about how clipping works and how to give my cat an organic shape. I noticed a little bit about the noise function which I'll have to look into in the future!
